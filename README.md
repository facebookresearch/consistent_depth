We present an algorithm for reconstructing dense, geometrically consistent depth for all pixels in a monocular video. We leverage a conventional structure-from-motion reconstruction to establish geometric constraints on pixels in the video. Unlike the ad-hoc priors in classical reconstruction, we use a learning-based prior, i.e., a convolutional neural network trained for single-image depth estimation. At test time, we fine-tune this network to satisfy the geometric constraints of a particular input video, while retaining its ability to synthesize plausible depth details in parts of the video that are less constrained. We show through quantitative validation that our method achieves higher accuracy and a higher degree of geometric consistency than previous monocular reconstruction methods. Visually, our results appear more stable. Our algorithm is able to handle challenging hand-held captured input videos with a moderate degree of dynamic motion. The improved quality of the reconstruction enables several applications, such as scene reconstruction and advanced video-based visual effects.

# Prerequisite
- Pull third-party packages.
  ```
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  ```
- Install python packages.
  ```
  conda create -n consistent_depth python=3.6
  conda activate consistent_depth
  ./scripts/install.sh
  ```
- [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org)
- Install COLMAP following https://colmap.github.io/install.html. Note **[COLMAP >= 3.6](https://github.com/colmap/colmap/releases)** is required to exclude [extracting features](https://colmap.github.io/faq.html#mask-image-regions) on dynamic objects. 
  If you are using Ubuntu, you can install COLMAP by [`./scripts/install_colmap_ubuntu.sh`](scripts/install_colmap_ubuntu.sh).
 

# Quick Start
You can run the following demo **without** installing **COLMAP**.
The demo takes 37 min when tested on one NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 GPU. 
- Download models and the demo video together with its precomputed COLMAP results. 
  ```
  ./scripts/download_model.sh
  ./scripts/download_demo.sh results/ayush
  ```
- Run
  ```
  python main.py --video_file data/videos/ayush.mp4 --path results/ayush \
    --camera_params "1671.770118, 540, 960" --camera_model "SIMPLE_PINHOLE" \
    --make_video
  ```
  where `1671.770118, 540, 960` is camera intrinsics (`f, cx, cy`) and `SIMPLE_PINHOLE` is the [camera model](https://colmap.github.io/cameras.html).
- You can inspect the test-time training process by 
  ```
  tensorboard --logdir results/ayush/R_hierarchical2_mc/B0.1_R1.0_PL1-0_LR0.0004_BS4_Oadam/tensorboard/ 
  ```
- You can find your results as below.
  ```
  results/ayush/R_hierarchical2_mc
    videos/
      color_depth_mc_depth_colmap_dense_B0.1_R1.0_PL1-0_LR0.0004_BS4_Oadam.mp4    # comparison of disparity maps from mannequin challenge, COLMAP and ours
    B0.1_R1.0_PL1-0_LR0.0004_BS4_Oadam/
      depth/                      # final disparity maps
      checkpoints/0020.pth        # final checkpoint
      eval/                       # disparity maps and losses after each epoch of training
  ```
  Expected output can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zsvmbc5iy2br8ol/AAAcEo5M9KYBSN7aiAuSPttka?dl=0).
    Your results can be different due to randomness in the test-time training process. 

The demo runs everything including flow estimation, test-time training, etc. except the COLMAP part for quick demonstration and ease of installation.
 To enable testing the COLMAP part, you can delete `results/ayush/colmap_dense` and  `results/ayush/depth_colmap_dense`.
 And then run the python command above again. 

# Customized Run:
Please refer to [`params.py`](params.py) or run `python main.py --help` for the full list of parameters. 
Here I demonstrate some examples for common usage of the system.
  
### Run on Your Own Videos
- Place your video file at `$video_file_path`. 
- [Optional] Calibrate camera using [`PINHOLE` (fx, fy, cx, cy) or `SIMPLE_PINHOLE` (f, cx, cy) model](https://colmap.github.io/cameras.html). 
Camera intrinsics calibration is optional but suggested for more accurate and faster camera registration. 
We typically calibrate the camera by capturing a video of a textured plane with really slow camera motion while trying to let target features
cover the full field of view, selecting non-blurry frames, running **COLMAP** on these images.
- Run 
    - Run without camera calibration.
      ```
      python main.py --video_file $video_file_path --path $output_path --make_video
      ```
    - Run with camera calibration. For instance, run with `PINHOLE` model and `fx, fy, cx, cy = 1660.161322, 1600, 540, 960`
      ```
      python main.py --video_file $video_file_path --path $output_path \
        --camera_model "PINHOLE" --camera_params "1660.161322, 1600, 540, 960" \
        --make_video
      ```
    - You can also specify backend monocular depth estimation network by
      ```
      python main.py --video_file $video_file_path --path $output_path \
        --camera_model "PINHOLE" --camera_params "1660.161322, 1600, 540, 960" \
        --make_video --model_type "${model_type}"
      ```
      The supported model types are `mc` ([Mannequin Challenge by Zhang et al. 2019](https://github.com/google/mannequinchallenge)),
      , `midas2` ([MiDaS by Ranftl el al. 2019](https://github.com/intel-isl/MiDaS)) 
      and `monodepth2` ([Monodepth2 by Godard et al. 2019](https://github.com/nianticlabs/monodepth2)).
       
### Run with Precomputed Camera Poses
We rely on **COLMAP** to for camera pose registration. If you have precomputed camera poses instead, 
you can provide them to the system in folder `$path` as follows.
(Example file structure of `$path` see [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/tdmhdesotk8ph4w/AAAV3wQodMMYjJ0NaJXwkWh1a?dl=0).)
- Save your color images as [`color_full/frame_%06d.png`](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/5zsmtity0punwjp/AABN4WdU2H2PVgjUfy3Ehwura?dl=0).
- Create `frame.txt` of format (example see [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1hmuvm4njledahx/frames.txt?dl=0)):
  ```
  number_of_frames
  width
  height
  frame_000000_timestamp_in_seconds
  frame_000001_timestamp_in_seconds
  ...
  ```
- Convert your camera pose to COLMAP sparse reconstruction format following [this](https://colmap.github.io/format.html#text-format).
  Put your `images.txt`, `cameras.txt` and `points3D.txt` (or `.bin`) under [`colmap_dense/pose_init/`](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/4f5t0tlvvmay9a3/AABVO1zNCPf7OQn3yDqdAoO3a?dl=0).
  Note that the `POINTS2D` in `images.txt` and the `points3D.txt` can be empty.
- Run.
  ```
  python main.py --path $path --initialize_pose
  ``` 
  
### Mask out Dynamic Object for Camera Pose Estimation
To get better pose for dynamic scene, you can mask out dynamic objects when extracting features with **COLMAP**. 
Note **[COLMAP >= 3.6](https://github.com/colmap/colmap/releases)** is required to [extract features in masked regions](https://colmap.github.io/faq.html#mask-image-regions). 
- Extract frames 
  ```
  python main.py --video_file $video_file_path --path $output_path --op extract_frames
  ```

- Run your favourite segmentation method (e.g., [Mask-RCNN](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2)) 
on images in `$output_path/color_full` to extract binary mask for dynamic objects (e.g., human). 
No features will be extracted in regions, where the mask image is black (pixel intensity value 0 in grayscale).
Following [COLMAP document](https://colmap.github.io/faq.html#mask-image-regions),
save the mask of frame `$output_path/color_full/frame_000010.png`, for instance, at `$output_path/mask/frame_000010.png.png`.

- Run the rest of the pipeline.
  ```
  python main.py --path $output_path --mask_path $output_path/mask \
    --camera_model "${camera_model}" --camera_params "${camera_intrinsics}" \
    --make_video
  ```
